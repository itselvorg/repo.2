            <hr>
            <p>Bohlokwa Ponahatso Moleleki aka elvPrince, a young upcoming artist born and raised in the Vaal, South of Johannesburg. Falling in love with RNB music from the young age of 6, Prince developed an ear for melody and ultimately began testing his vocal abilities with his brother who would beatbox and his sisters who would sing along with him. With influence from his older brother Champ, who had already began exploring rap music, and his admiring of the South African giant Nasty C, Prince found a love for Hip Hop. From "borrowing" some of his brother's lyrics and flows from Nasty C, he eventually began writing his own songs. At the age of 10 he recorded his first song titled "Guess Who's Back" which featured two of his close friends Marema aka Zouza and Nqobile aka Antidote who lost his life in the recent years. To date, Prince has released music on major streaming platforms like Apple Music, Spotify, YouTube, as well as SoundCloud etc. On 20 October 2023 he released his first short EP titled Nadir, which is compiled of songs that he wrote during times of adversity as his way of staying afloat. Prince expresses that he is excited for the next few years of his career as he is working on his craft and his team to make sure that he delivers the best art he can for the Glory of God, and for his supporters. "My life is my story for which God is the author, where He leads me I know He will make a wa. My gifts and talents will not go to waste." says the Music Scientist.</p>
